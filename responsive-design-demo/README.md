## Tips and tricks

* Design for mobile upfront to ensure a great user experience for all users.   
* Content is king! For a better user experience, strive to have all functionality be accessible for all devices.
* Let your content determine the breakpoints.
* Remember that width/height media queries take into account the viewport and not for individual sections/containers.
* Even though CSS covers most of your responsive-design needs, JavaScript may still be needed when dealing with 3rd-party libraries or to react to viewport sections/containers.
